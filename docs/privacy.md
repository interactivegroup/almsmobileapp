Privacy notice Alms Mobile Application
Who are we?
Interactive Group Pvt Ltd is a software company which allows educators, of any kind, to create a private space online, filled with tools that easily create courses and activities, all optimized for collaborative learning. The Alms software is open source, and may be hosted by Interactive Group Pvt. Ltd, but also by anyone who wishes to manage an installation. The Alms Mobile application is the mobile version of the Alms software made available by Interactive Group Pvt. Ltd. 

Apart from the Alms Mobile application, Interactive Group Pvt. Ltd could also provide to its users additional services that could be accessed through external websites hosted or not by Interactive Group Pvt. Ltd. In those cases if the collection and processing of personal data is required the consent of any user is collected on the relevant  external website(s) and complaint with the applicable Privacy Law. Since we take Privacy very seriously we have adopted the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a global standard.

What’s covered by this Privacy Notice?
Under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) personal data is defined as: “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.

No personal data is collected or processed through the Alms Mobile application.

Why the Alms Mobile application does not need to collect and store personal data?
Interactive Group Pvt. Ltd is a company which values its users’ data protection and privacy rights and we have no interest in collecting data beyond what we need to make our service(s) work for you. Simply, we do not need your personal data to provide you with our Alms Mobile application.

If we provide you with separate additional services through external installations hosted or not by Interactive Group Pvt. Ltd, we will always seek a confirmation from you that it’s ok to do that.

Additional services provided by Interactive Group Pvt. Ltd are completely separate from the Alms Mobile application and in case it is needed we will submit for your consent the relevant  Privacy notice and explain how personal data related to you for specific purposes are collected and what is the nature of the data collected depending on your interaction with Interactive Group Pvt. Ltd. We are committed to transparency in this and we will provide a very detailed breakdown of these processes in the applicable Privacy Notice submitted.
